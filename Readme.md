# FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification

## What is FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification (FOCUS)?

FOCUS is the FinOps Foundation community specification that works to establish an open standard for cloud billing data. It specifies vendor neutral cross-cloud measures for key cost & usage dimensions/metrics. These measures and their derivations establish a baseline schema that enables cloud billing data to be surfaced in a common FinOps-serviceable format.

## What problem are we trying to solve?

Thereâ€™s no standard way to normalize key cloud cost and usage measures across multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Software as a Service (SaaS) products, or license sellers. This creates challenges for stakeholders when making decisions and quantifying the business value of cloud. This project will define a consistent set of measures, describe their origins, and prescribe and approach for surfacing the corresponding billing data via a shared data schema that is serviceable across all billing sources.

This open specification will be critical for the FinOps community, especially as more and more service providers continue to enter the market with their own billing data formats and measures.

## Why are we building this as a specification?

The FinOps Foundation is the Sponsoring Project of FOCUS, but FOCUS will be a standalone specification Project to better protect and manage the intellectual property rights that will be necessary for users of the FOCUS Project outputs. In order for organizations to trust the specifications and reference implementations that result from the FOCUS Project, they must be able to rely upon the right to use these work products under the terms of license agreements.

Establishing a technical Project allows contributions, contributors, license rights, and any intellectual property rights to be clearly and precisely tracked over time. This ensures that those contributing to and relying upon the specification are protected.

## How to get started with FOCUS?

FOCUS will be developed using a hybrid contribution model, meaning that changes and additions may be proposed either via Github issues and pull requests or at FOCUS Working Group meetings. Github will be the official system of record for the Specifications and any other work products. The contribution model will be officially defined in the FOCUS repository.

The Project will have multiple tiers of membership once established, but will work toward consensus approval of changes in every case possible. If you have a technical contribution to make to the Project, please contact us using the link below. If you would like to review or license the specification, reference implementations or other work products, please continue to check back here in January 2023 to review the details available at that time.

Also, please review the Code_of_Conduct.md, Scope.md, Notices.md and License.md files. Instructions for contributors are included in the Contributing.md file.

## Who develops and maintains FOCUS?

The specification is being developed by the [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org) community with inspiration, guidance and resources from [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org), the [Open Web Foundation agreements](https://openwebfoundation.org), the [Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0](https://aomedia.org/license/patent-license/), and the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).
