# FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification

## What is FinOps Open Cost & Usasge Specification (FOCUS)?

FOCUS is the FinOps Foundation community specification that establishes an open standard for cloud billing data. It specifies vendor neutral cross-cloud measures for key cost & usage dimensions/metrics. These measures and their derivations establish a baseline schema that enables cloud billing data to be surfaced in a common FinOps serviceable format.

## What problem are we trying to solve?

There is no standard for surfacing key cloud cost & usage measures across multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). This creates challenges for stakeholders when making decisions and quantifying the business value of cloud.  This project will define a consistent set of measures, describing their origins, and a prescribed approach for surfacing the corresponding billing data via a shared data schema that is serviceable across all CSP's. This open-billing standard will be critical for the FinOps community, especially as more and more service providers continue to enter the market with their own billing data formats and measures.


## Why are we working on a FinOps Open Cost & Usage Specification?

By defining a specification for surfacing key cloud cost & usage measures across multiple CSPs,  this FinOps project and its working-groups support the FinOps Foundation mission to create open standards and best practices for individuals that are managing the value of cloud.
